The purpose of this project is to conduct a Customer Segmentation Analysis. This project aims to analyze customer transaction data to gain insights into customer segments and their brand loyalty. By identifying customer segments and assessing their loyalty, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall profitability. Customer segmentation is performed by developing a RFM Model. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. The data quality assessment and analysis is done using Python.
